I am doing a Postdoc at Arizona State University under the supervision of Prof. [Selcuk Candan](https://search.asu.edu/profile/20861) and Prof. [Huan Liu](https://www.public.asu.edu/~huanliu/). I received my Ph.D. in Computer Engineering from Seoul National University advised by Prof. [Chong-Kwon Kim](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=KRykCKkAAAAJ&hl=en). I received my B.S. in Computer Science from the University of Seoul. My research interests include data mining, graph algorithms, and large language models.
